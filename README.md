# Hypothesis Testing
Performed a hypothesis test using a two-sample t-test in Python to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine by comparing outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
The test was designed to assess whether the difference in health outcomes (e.g., symptom severity) between the two groups was statistically significant
# Data Pre-processing(Data Cleaning)
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data science workflow, ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or machine learning. This process involves transforming raw data into a suitable format by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing features, and more.
